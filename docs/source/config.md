# Configuration

## Environment Variables

You can modify Conda Project configuration settings using these environment variables.

### CONDA_PROJECT_ENVS_PATH

This variable provides a list of directories to search for environments
to use in projects, and where to build them when needed. The format
is identical to a standard `PATH` variable on the host
operating system---a list of directories separated by `:` on Unix systems
and `;` on Windows---except that empty entries are permitted. The paths
are interpreted as follows:

- If a path is empty, it is interpreted as the default value `envs`.
- If a path is relative, it is interpreted relative to the root directory
  of the project itself (`PROJECT_DIR`). For example, a path entry
  `envs` is interpreted as

  - `$PROJECT_DIR/envs` (Unix)
  - `%PROJECT_DIR%\envs` (Windows)

- When searching for an environment, the directories are searched in
  left-to-right order.
- If an environment with the requested name is found nowhere in the path,
  one will be created as a subdirectory of the first entry in the path.

For example, given a Unix machine with

`CONDA_PROJECT_ENVS_PATH=/opt/envs::envs2:/home/user/conda/envs`

Then Anaconda Project will look for an environment named `default`
in the following locations:

- `/opt/envs/default`
- `$PROJECT_DIR/envs/default`
- `$PROJECT_DIR/envs2/default`
- `/home/user/conda/envs/default`

If no such environment exists, one will be created as `/opt/envs/default`,
instead of the default location of `$PROJECT_DIR/envs/default`.
